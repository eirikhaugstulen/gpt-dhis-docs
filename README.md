# DHIS2-GPT-DOCS

DHIS2-GPT-DOCS is an application that provides users with an intuitive conversational interface with knowledge of the DHIS2 documentation. It is built on top of advanced natural language processing techniques that enable users to ask questions and receive relevant information from the DHIS2 documentation without the need for extensive technical knowledge.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental

This repository is only a side-project of mine to play around with the possibilities of combining DHIS2 with LLM's and ChatGPT.
<br />
It is not built by or related to the DHIS2 core team.

## üåßÔ∏è Limitations

üíæ The application has no memory. This means that follow up questions without any context is not going to be answered correctly.
<br />
<br />
üìë Only small parts of the documentation has been vectorized as part of this MVP. Check `./src/documents` to see which data has been imported.

## How it's Built

This application uses the following techniques to provide users with meaningful answers:

1. DHIS2-GPT-DOCS leverages vectorization techniques to break down the DHIS2 documentation into smaller parts that can be easily indexed and searched.
2. The vectorized documentation is stored in a Supabase backend for ease of use.
3. The application uses Top-K Cosine similarity search to match user queries with relevant parts of the DHIS2 documentation.
4. The user query and the related context is then wrapped in a pre-formatted prompt and sent to ChatGPT to answer in a user-centric way.
